# Fucking Yikes! May s, 2021.  

# Jason Calacanis, This Week in Podcaster and founder.

Today's Fucking Yikes! thought it was 'funny' to threaten to fire employeees who talk politics at work.

He did it by paying homage to a previous Fucking Yikes!, Jason & David the CEO & CTOs of Basecamp, a company that lets you pay for email.

## What happened?

Jason announced a shitty 'joke' policy [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jstrand/status/1389017138925424641).

## That must have been upsetting. Did he try to downplay the offense by saying he was just joking?

He did! 

## Oh my. Did he log on the next morning and continue to belabor his point without realizing that non-white people and non-men don't get a choice as to wether their existence is political?

Indeed, he looked like quite a jerk in doing so.
