# Fucking Yikes! April 27, 2021.  

# David Heinemeir Hanson and Jason Fried, the CEO and CTO co-founders of Basecamp. 

Yesterday's Fucking Yikes! did it again today, when the two tech co-founders of a small company doubled down on banning political discussion at work. 
\
This time they did it by paying homage to a previous Fucking Yikes!, the CEO of Coinbase, a company that lets you speculate on destroying the environment.

## Having the same Fucking Yikes! two days in a row does make it easier to keep track. What happened?

Casey Newton did a journalism ("[Breaking Camp](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy)") and laid out the backstory.

## That must have been upsetting. Did they explain themselves?

They did! 

## It made things worse, didn't it. 

Well, after Casey made his report, David wrote _another_ blog post, this one called [Let it all out](https://world.hey.com/dhh/let-it-all-out-78485e8e).
