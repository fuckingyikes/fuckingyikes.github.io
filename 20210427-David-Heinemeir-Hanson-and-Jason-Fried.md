# Fucking Yikes! April 26, 2021.  

# David Heinemeir Hanson and Jason Fried, the CEO and CTO co-founders of Basecamp. 

Two co-founders of a small tech company that makes old project management software, a new email service and invented the software that powered Twitter's fail whale banned talking about politics at work. 

They announced this policy on a blog post on April 26, 2021. 

And then doubled down.

A lot.

## Who are we Fucking Yikes! about?

David Heinemeir Hanson and Jason Fried, the CEO and CTO co-founders of Basecamp.

## Oh, tech people. This should be good. Go on.

Jason, the CEO, wrote a [blog post](https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5).

## Already this feels ominous.

You're right, the blog post was called [Changes at Basecamp](https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5).

##  I'll get my popcorn. What was it about?

The usual stuff: an opinion that instead of offering defined benefits like a wellness allowance or  continuing education, they should just give employees a bunch of money and let employees decide.

## Fair enough. And?

They're not going to do 360 reviews anymore.

## Hmmmmm.

And they're going to focus on what they do. Which was point 6 in the blog post, "_No forgetting what we do here_."

## My yikes-sense is tingling. Are we close?

We are, yes we're getting close!

## Don't tease me. Out with it.

"We make project management, team communication, and email software. We are not a social impact company."

## I can feel it coming. Hit me.

Right, right. The first item in the blog post was: 

> No more societal and political discussions on our company Basecamp account.

## Yikes!

Yep. 

## Did they say why having societal and political discussions on their account isn't allowed?

They did! It's because 

> Today's social and political waters are especially choppy. Sensitivities are at 11, and every discussion remotely related to politics, advocacy, or society at large quickly spins away from pleasant.

## I bet that must be exhausting. 

Yep. 

"It's become too much. It's a major distraction. It saps our energy, and redirects our dialog towards dark places."  

## They must have offered something, as a treat?

Employees were told they could still continue "difficult discussions with willing colleagues on other systems.

## What made this _Fucking Yikes!?_

They kept digging.

## Of course they did

Really, they kept digging a lot. Twitter had opinions, so  David, the CTO wrote another blog post on the same day. 

This one was called [Basecamp's new etiquette regarding societal politics at work](https://world.hey.com/dhh/basecamp-s-new-etiquette-regarding-societal-politics-at-work-b44bef69).

## "Etiquette"

Exactly.

# David Heinemeir Hanson and Jason Fried, the CEO and CTO co-founders of Basecamp. 

Yesterday's Fucking Yikes! did it again today, when the two tech co-founders of a small company doubled down on banning political discussion at work. 
\
This time they did it by paying homage to a previous Fucking Yikes!, the CEO of Coinbase, a company that lets you speculate on destroying the environment.

## Having the same Fucking Yikes! two days in a row does make it easier to keep track. What happened?

Casey Newton did a journalism ("[Breaking Camp](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy)") and laid out the backstory.

## That must have been upsetting. Did they explain themselves?

They did! 

## It made things worse, didn't it. 

Well, after Casey made his report, David wrote _another_ blog post, this one called [Let it all out](https://world.hey.com/dhh/let-it-all-out-78485e8e).
